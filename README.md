## DAPP FLOW

1. This section allows a user to register an airline. An Airline can be registered in two ways, 
(i) by selecting a metamask account and clicking the first button, or (ii) by providing an ethereum address directly in the inputbox and clicking the second button.

Only after registering an airline can it be made to provide funds. To do that, input a fund amount in the second input, and click the "Fund Selected Airline" button.

2. A passenger can buy an insurance using this section. To do that, select a suitable metamask account that represents your first passenger, next select a Flight from the dropdown, provide an insurance amount, and then lastly click the Buy Insurance button.

3. In this section, you can simulate Fetching flight status, which triggers the listenening oracles to provide random flight statuses. After upto 3 oracles provide a status of 20, the logic that triggers insurance calculation would then be invoked. 
Click on Fetch Flight status and on another window watch the oracles provide response to the smart contract, if up to 3 provide the cancelled status, click on the "Get Insurance Claim" button to see how much is due. 
Next proceed to withdraw the amount using the last button.
